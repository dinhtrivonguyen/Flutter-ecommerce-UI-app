# Flutter E-commerce UI App - First Demo
Oct 9,2020

This is the first application I practiced with Flutter. MoiMetMoi is an e-commerce application exclusively for students at FPT University Danang.

## Update
Jan 8, 2021

Currently the demo product is used for the OSG202 subject. I had some difficulties with back-end programming, so the project switched to e-commerce chatbots - this made the number of students accessing faster and more convenient.

## Installation

    Download Flutter
    Install this repository
    The project should run on flutter version 1.0.0

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dinhtrivonguyen/flutter-app-ecommerce.git
flutter packages get
flutter run # make sure your mobile device is connected
```
